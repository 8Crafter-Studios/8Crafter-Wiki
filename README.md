This is 8Crafter's wiki, containing documentation, tutorials, and general how-to information, for most of the stuff made by 8Crafter, including Minecraft add-ons, Node.js apps, etc.

## Contributing

You've found a typo, couldn't get along with a guide because it was too complicated or want to write your own guide to help other users?
Then you've come to the right place!

If you want to help me create more complex things, like adding a new page or fixing some typos yourself, I have a dedicated [Contribute Page](https://wiki.8crafter.com/contribute) on my wiki,
which describes every step you need to follow. If you have some questions, there are some really nice people in my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/jrCTeHGuhx).

### Code and Platform

The wiki uses a custom [VitePress theme](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/), and is statically generated from the `wiki` branch into the `generated` branch.

If you are interested in helping us maintain the core platform, as opposed to the Markdown articles, [join the discord](https://discord.gg/jrCTeHGuhx)!

### Running Locally

-   `npm install`
-   `npm run dev` (run in dev mode)
-   `npm run build` (test a release mode bundle)

-# This wiki is made using the bedrock wiki (wiki.bedrock.dev) as a template.
