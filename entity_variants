Entity variants should be defined as an entity with a different looking than usually, and according to what you want to acomplish you could also change its stats.

On this page you will learn how to add your own variants to your entities, changing their model and texture, and how to change them in-game by using commands.

## minecraft:variant

According to Microsoft documentation, `minecraft:variant` is used to differentiate the component group of a variant of an entity from others, such as ocelot, villager and horse. We want to use this component at our `entity.json` located at `BP/entities` to differentiate the default variant, which is the entity with no modifications, between our new variant.

So let's get started by adding this component in our `entity.json` components, just like this:

```
"minecraft:variant":{
    "value": 0
}
```

After having this done, we want to add a component group in order to change its variant, and it will be done just like this:

```
"component_groups": {
    "wiki:variant_change": {
        "minecraft:variant": {
            "value": 1
                    }
             }
      }
}
```

We have the main part done, now in order to changing the variant in-game we need to make an event call the component group, this is done this way:

```
"events": {
   "wiki:my_event": {
      "add": {
         "component_groups":[
           "wiki:variant_change"
                ]
           }
      }
```

Now we are completly done with the entity's behavior, so we will move to the `entity.client.json` file at `RP/entity/`.

## entity.client.json

In the previosly mentioned file, we need to mention all the textures we want to have, in this example im modifying the vanilla `player.entity.json` file to make it able to use the zombie texture:

```
"textures": {
        "default": "textures/entity/steve",
        "cape": "textures/entity/cape_invisible",
        "variant_one": "textures/entity/zombie/zombie"
      }
```

Remember that in this example, `default`, `cape`, and `variant_one` are our own namespaces, so we can change them to whatever we wish. Next to the namespace is our textures directories.


Let's now mention all the geometries we want to list for our entity:

```
"geometry": {
        "default": "geometry.humanoid.custom",
        "cape": "geometry.cape",
        "variant_one": "geometry.zombie"
      }
```

We are now done with the `entity.client.json` file!
