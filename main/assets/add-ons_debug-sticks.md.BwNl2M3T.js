It is one of the most powerful bedrock add-ons that currently exists.</p><h2 id="general-description" tabindex="-1">General Description <a class="header-anchor" href="#general-description" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;General Description&quot;">​</a></h2><p>    This is an add-on that adds the debug stick, as well as an editor stick, which lets you see block info when you crouch and can be used on a block to change the block type (you can even change it to blocks that normally require NBT editors to obtain), change some of the block states of the block, change the raw text of a sign, change the color of the liquid in a cauldron (even for lava and powdered snow), change the potion in a cauldron, set whether or not the block is waterlogged, etc.</p><p>    It also allows you to have chat ranks, change your name in the chat, and have custom colors and formatting codes automatically applied to your messages, it also adds some custom chat commands, it also adds three different debug menus, one for the world details, one for player details, and one for entity details, it also adds a player controller that lets you do things like change a player&#39;s name tag, active selected hotbar slot, change whether or not they have operator permissions, start cooldowns on their items, apply knockback to them, kill them, despawn them, apply damage to them, add effects or tags to them, remove effects or tags from them, teleport them, set them on fire for a certain amount of time, set their spawn point to a very specific point in a specified dimension, etc. Then there is also an entity controller that does a lot of the same stuff as the player controller (except for the stuff that can only be used on the players) but also has a few other features too. Then there is an item modifier that lets you change the lore and name of an item (you can even use multiple lines of text in the lore too), you can also have multiple lines of text in the item names, you can also set the components of an item (like lock in slot, lock in inventory, can destroy, can place on, and also keep on death), you can also trigger item events for custom items, you can also transfer items in between players inventories. Then there is also a world controller that lets you do stuff like send internal client messages, set the weather in a specific dimension, send /tellraw messages to all players without needing to type out the /tellraw command, you can also set the world spawn, absolute world time, current time of day, spawn entities, spawn items, spawn particles with specified molang values (so you can use particles that are normally broken with the /particle command), etc. There is also an explosion creator that lets you create custom explosions at specified coordinates with a specified radius, and you can also specify whether or not it causes fire, whether or not it destroys blocks, whether or not it can explode underwater, and also which entity has caused the explosions.</p><h2 id="main-features" tabindex="-1">Main Features <a class="header-anchor" href="#main-features" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Main Features&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li>WorldEdit</li><li>100% Customizable Chat Ranks.
