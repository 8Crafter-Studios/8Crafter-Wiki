Well, this texture pack fixes that. This texture pack has 5 sub-packs: &quot;Completely Remove the Player List&quot; removes the UI element for showing what players are online, &quot;Hide Only Some Info - Style 1/2&quot; just removes the part showing their names, makes it so they can&#39;t click on a player&#39;s name to see their Xbox Profile/Microsoft Account, and also makes the part showing if they are operator blank but still clickable by actual operators, &quot;Remove All of the Content in the Sidebar&quot; does exactly what it says, it removes all of the content in the sidebar, &quot;Completely Remove the Sidebar&quot; just completely removes the entire sidebar. This is especially good if you use my other addon to let you change your name tag and chat name, and then you use /tellraw to say that you left, and then use /tellraw to say that a person with the name that you set your new name tag and chat name to just joined.</p><p><img src="https://modbay.org/uploads/posts/2024-01/medium/8crafters-online-player-hider-without-the-pack-enabled-without-a-list-scoreboard.png" alt="Without the pack enabled without a list scoreboard"></p><p>Without the pack enabled without a list scoreboard</p><p><img src="https://modbay.org/uploads/posts/2024-01/medium/8crafters-online-player-hider-without-the-pack-enabled-with-a-list-scoreboard.png" alt="Without the pack enabled with a list scoreboard"></p><p>Without the pack enabled with a list scoreboard</p><p><img src="https://modbay.org/uploads/posts/2024-01/medium/8crafters-online-player-hider-remove-all-of-the-content-in-the-sidebar-subpack.png" alt="&quot;Remove All of the Content in the Sidebar&quot; subpack"></p><p>&quot;Remove All of the Content in the Sidebar&quot; subpack</p><p><img src="https://modbay.org/uploads/posts/2024-01/medium/8crafters-online-player-hider-completely-remove-the-player-list-subpack-without-a-list-scoreboard.png" alt="&quot;Completely Remove the Player List&quot; subpack without a list scoreboard"></p><p>&quot;Completely Remove the Player List&quot; subpack without a list scoreboard</p><p><img src="https://modbay.org/uploads/posts/2024-01/medium/8crafters-online-player-hider-completely-remove-the-player-list-subpack-with-a-list-scoreboard.png" alt="&quot;Completely Remove the Player List&quot; subpack with a list scoreboard"></p><p>&quot;Completely Remove the Player List&quot; subpack with a list scoreboard</p><p><img src="https://modbay.org/uploads/posts/2024-01/medium/8crafters-online-player-hider-completely-remove-the-sidebar-subpack.png" alt="&quot;Completely Remove the Sidebar&quot; subpack"></p><p>&quot;Completely Remove the Sidebar&quot; subpack</p><p><img src="https://modbay.org/uploads/posts/2024-01/medium/8crafters-online-player-hider-hide-only-some-info-style-1-subpack-with-a-list-scoreboard.png" alt="&quot;Hide Only Some Info - Style 1&quot; subpack with a list scoreboard"></p><p>&quot;Hide Only Some Info - Style 1&quot; subpack with a list scoreboard</p><p><img src="https://modbay.org/uploads/posts/2024-01/medium/8crafters-online-player-hider-hide-only-some-info-style-1-subpack-without-a-list-scoreboard.png" alt="&quot;Hide Only Some Info - Style 1&quot; subpack without a list scoreboard"></p><p>&quot;Hide Only Some Info - Style 1&quot; subpack without a list scoreboard</p><p><img src="https://modbay.org/uploads/posts/2024-01/medium/8crafters-online-player-hider-hide-only-some-info-style-2-subpack-with-a-list-scoreboard.png" alt="&quot;Hide Only Some Info - Style 2&quot; subpack with a list scoreboard"></p><p>&quot;Hide Only Some Info - Style 2&quot; subpack with a list scoreboard</p><p><img src="https://modbay.org/uploads/posts/2024-01/medium/8crafters-online-player-hider-hide-only-some-info-style-2-subpack-without-a-list-scoreboard.png" alt="&quot;Hide Only Some Info - Style 2&quot; subpack without a list scoreboard"></p><p>&quot;Hide Only Some Info - Style 2&quot; subpack without a list scoreboard</p>',23))])}const w=a(h,[["render",c]]);export{q as __pageData,w as default};
