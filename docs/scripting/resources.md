JavaScript is a well-known scripting language over the internet. Learning JavaScript will be helpful to you to build and develop an add-on with Script API.

You are advised to learn JavaScript free from online courses available online, such as the following:

- [MDN JavaScript: JavaScript language overview](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Language_Overview)
- [Codecademy: Introduction to JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)
- [freeCodeCamp.org: JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/)

Minecraft Bedrock Edition uses a their own version of JavaScript, which is based on QuickJS. It uses the ECMAScript module (ESM) system for organizing and loading code, which allows for a more modular and organized approach to writing scripts for the game.
