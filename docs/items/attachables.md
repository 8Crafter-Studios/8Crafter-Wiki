This tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of MoLang, render controllers, animations, and client entity definitions. Ensure to check out the [client entity tutorial](/entities/entity-intro-rp) before starting this tutorial!

## Introduction

When we design a custom item or block, Minecraft will build a model from a template so the item can be displayed when held. This takes the form of the item's sprite being an extruded texture mesh, or blocks displaying with their model. But by using a system called **attachables** we can design our own models to be displayed when these items are held.

Ever wanted sticks to look like spyglasses? Or to wield a big chainsaw with a spinning chain? Attachables are the way to accomplish that!

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:

<Checklist>

-   [ ] Understand how attachable definitions are made
-   [ ] Make or edit a geometry to be compatible for attachables
-   [ ] Set up animations to display the geometry in Minecraft

</Checklist>

## Overview

Attachable files are quite similar in design to client entity definitions; they let us define textures, materials, geometries, and animations to display the attachable.

Here's a basic example of an attachable, which we will be using throughout this tutorial. This makes a stick look like a spyglass:

<CodeHeader>RP/attachables/stick.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
	"format_version": "1.10.0",
	"minecraft:attachable": {
		"description": {
			"identifier": "minecraft:stick",
			"materials": {
				"default": "entity",
				"enchanted": "entity_alphatest_glint"
			},
			"textures": {
				"default": "textures/entity/spyglass",
				"enchanted": "textures/misc/enchanted_item_glint"
			},
			"geometry": {
				"default": "geometry.spyglass"
			},
			"animations": {
				"wield": "animation.spyglass.holding"
			},
			"scripts": {
				"animate": [
					"wield"
				]
			},
			"render_controllers": [
				"controller.render.item_default"
			]
		}
	}
}
```

If you work with entities often, this should look pretty familiar. A couple of key things to point out with attachable definitions:
- The attachable's identifier matches an existing item identifier. Any items or blocks with that ID will use the corresponding attachable.
- There is a material and texture listed for the enchantment glint. This is important to keep around if your item should have the glint when enchanted.

Making attachables is more involved than making a client entity file though, as the geometry needs to be set up a certain way and animations are tricky to set up.

## Geometry

For this tutorial's demonstration, a model of Steve's head will be used. The same principles can be applied to any custom model you want to use.

<BButton link="https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/bedrock-wiki/blob/wiki/docs/public/assets/packs/tutorials/attachables/steve_head.geo.json?raw=true">üìÑ Steve head model</BButton>

In the attachable file, change the geometry name to `"geometry.steve_head"` and the default texture path to `"textures/entity/steve"`:

<CodeHeader>RP/attachables/spyglass.json</CodeHeader>

```json
"textures": {
	"default": "textures/entity/steve",
	"enchanted": "textures/misc/enchanted_item_glint"
},
"geometry": {
	"default": "geometry.steve_head"
},
```

It is important to make sure your model can work with attachables. Our first step is to upgrade the model file format to "1.16.0" if it is not already. If the model is a legacy file, then convert that to a more modern format before continuing.

Next up is modifying the root bone of the geometry to be bound to the slot the item is placed in. Take careful note of the key on line 16 in the Steve head model below:

<CodeHeader>RP/models/entity/steve_head.geo.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
	"format_version": "1.16.0",
	"minecraft:geometry": [
		{
			"description": {
				"identifier": "geometry.steve_head",
				"texture_width": 64,
				"texture_height": 64,
				"visible_bounds_width": 3,
				"visible_bounds_height": 3,
				"visible_bounds_offset": [0, 1.5, 0]
			},
			"bones": [
				{
					"name": "steve_head",
					"binding": "q.item_slot_to_bone_name(c.item_slot)",
					"pivot": [0, 4, 0],
					"cubes": [
						{"origin": [-4, 0, -4], "size": [8, 8, 8], "uv": [0, 0]}
					]
				}
			]
		}
	]
}
```
While the `"parent"` key on a bone accepts a string and will make the target bone the parent of the source bone, the `"binding"` key accepts Molang and sets the target bone as the *root position* that the source bone and its children should inherit. This will have consequences in the next section where we make animations.

For the value of `"binding"` we are using the Molang query `query.item_slot_to_bone_name`, with the contextual variable `c.item_slot` as an argument. This converts the name of the slot to its corresponding bone name in the player's geometry. The conversions are `'main_hand'` ‚Üí "rightitem" and `'off_hand'` ‚Üí "leftitem".

*If we look in Minecraft the head floats below our hand. Levitation powers perhaps?*


## Display Settings

With that done, the next step is to set up animations to display the model in first person and third person. In the attachable file, change the animations object to include an animation for holding the item in both first person and third person, then change the scripts to animate them depending on context:

<CodeHeader>RP/attachables/spyglass.json</CodeHeader>

```json
"animations": {
	"hold_first_person": "animation.steve_head.hold_first_person",
	"hold_third_person": "animation.steve_head.hold_third_person"
},
"scripts": {
	"animate": [
		{
			"hold_first_person": "c.is_first_person"
		},
		{
			"hold_third_person": "!c.is_first_person"
		}
	]
},
```

Attached below is a template to assist with setting up these animations, using a modified player geometry.

::: tip
These files already have our Steve head model imported for this tutorial to serve as an example. If you are running into problems, compare your model setup to these!
:::

Using a text editor, edit the geometry file to include the bones and cubes from your custom model. Then open the geometry in Blockbench, and set your model to be parented under the bone you wish to set positions for (rightItem or leftItem).

In the animations tab, import the Attachable Guide animations you will need. You may then make new animations to position the bones in your model as desired. Some example animations for our Steve head model are supplied as well, for the first-person and third-person held in the right hand.

Be sure to play the template animations while you make adjustments, as these will ensure what you see in Blockbench matches what comes out in Minecraft. Also make sure you are editing the bones of your model, and not the `rightArm` or `rightItem` bones from the template.

### First-person Animations

For creating first person animations, create a new camera angle with the following values to replicate the first-person view in Minecraft:

*You can pull this up by clicking on ‚â° "Preview" ‚Üí "Save Angle...".*

## Conclusion

After the geometry is modified and the animations are saved, the item in-game should appear exactly as it does in Blockbench. You can then add any additional animations, models, textures, and whatever else you want to the attachable definition to customize it however you want.
