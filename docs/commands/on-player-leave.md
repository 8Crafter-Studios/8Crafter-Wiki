## Introduction

[Sourced By Bedrock Commands Community Discord](https://discord.gg/SYstTYx5G5)

This system will run your desired commands on the event that a player leaves the world.

:::tip
Note; you cannot execute commands on the players that leave but you can use [On Player Death](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/commands/on-player-death.html) system to execute when they join back.

Here we have used a **`/say`** command as an example but you can use any command you prefer and as many as you require.

Just make sure to follow the given order and properly use the `/execute if score` command as shown to run the commands you need.

## Explanation

**` new `** this FakePlayer name means the total number of players on the world in the current game tick.

**` old `** this FakePlayer name means the total number of players that were on the world in the previous game tick.

ã…¤These values are obtained using the <#992671972205019236> system.

By subtracting 'old' total from 'new' total we will be able to check if player count has:
- decreased ` ..-1 `
- increased ` 1.. `
- or if it's unchanged ` 0 `

If it has decreased; we know that 1 or more players have left the game.
With this knowledge we can run our desired commands from the 'new' FakePlayer name with -1 score or less in the objective **total**

The 'new' total value is obtained first, subtraction is performed after that to run your desired commands and lastly the 'old' total value is obtained.

> Note; all commands listed in a command-line will only run in a sequence but it all still happens in the same tick regardless of the number of commands involved.
