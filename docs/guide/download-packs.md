This is an appendix page. You can start the guide from the beginning [here](/guide/index).

To get the most out of the guide, you should always attempt all guide-exercises yourself! However if you get very stuck, the example packs should give you some valuable reference material.

Download here:

-   <a href="https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/bedrock-wiki/blob/wiki/docs/public/assets/packs/guide/guide_RP.zip?raw=true">Resource Pack Download</a>
-   <a href="https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/bedrock-wiki/blob/wiki/docs/public/assets/packs/guide/guide_BP.zip?raw=true">Behavior Pack Download</a>.

To install, simply unzip the behavior pack into the Minecraft folder: `com.mojang\development_behavior_packs` or `com.mojang\development_*_packs`, depending on which pack you downloaded.
