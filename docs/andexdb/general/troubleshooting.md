<Spoiler title="A lot of the items from the add-on are missing from the game.">

### Step 1

Double check that both the resource and behavior packs are on. Sometimes Minecraft will only import one of the packs, so you may need to import the add-on again.

### Step 2

Check that all the required experimental toggles are enabled. You have have every experimental toggle except for villager trading turned on. You should also have the education edition toggle turned on.

### Step 3

Check that the version of the add-on you are using is compatible with your current version of Minecraft. If you are not sure if it is compatible, and you are on the latest full release of Minecraft, then just download the newest version of the add-on.

### Step 4

If it is still not working, contact me either through my email or my discord.
