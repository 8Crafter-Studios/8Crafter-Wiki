:::warning IMPORTANT
This add-on breaks every medium-sized update (ex. 1.21.0, 1.21.20, 1.21.30, or 1.21.40) and must be updated whenever that happens.

Your data will be preserved when updating the pack to a newer version.
:::

When setting up the add-on you must first make sure that you have the following experimental toggles enabled:

-   Upcoming Creator Features

-   Beta APIs

-   Creator Cameras: New Third Person Presets

-   Creator Cameras: Focus Target Camera

Also make sure that you have the `Education Edition` toggle enabled.

Once you have downloaded the add-on and enabled the required experimental toggles continue to the next section.

### Step 6

Make sure that **_ALL_** of the experimental toggles in the `Add-On Creators` section are enabled.

Note: If your world does not already have at least one experimental toggle enabled, then enabling any of the experimental toggles will create a copy of your world that has the toggle enabled.

Note: Enabling the `Villager Trade Rebalancing` toggle is **_NOT_** recommended.

### Step 14

Enabling the `Shared packs` (Also known as `Require players to accept resource packs to join`) option is **_NOT_** required, and is not recommended as the option also stops players from using their global resource packs, so if a player wanted to use RTX or they had a texture pack they liked to use, they would not be able to use it. The players will already be required to download the packs for the add-on because they are a dependency of the behavior pack, so enabling this option is unnecessary. You should only enable it if you want to stop people from using local resource packs such as RTX packs and other texture packs.
