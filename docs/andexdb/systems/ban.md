## How do I ban a player (who has joined the world before)?

1.  Open the [Main Menu](../main-menu/main-menu) (use the [`\mainmenu`{lang=acmd}](../commands-list/-mainmenu.md) command or the [Main Menu stick](../general/items#Main-Menu)).
2.  Scroll down and click "Manage Players".

5.  Click either "Add ID Ban" or "Add Name Ban", it is recommended to use an ID ban, because then they can't get around the ban by changing their username.
