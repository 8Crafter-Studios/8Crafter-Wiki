## Fixes

### Chat Ranks

-   When the option to show a player's current dimension in the chat ranks is enabled, it now adds a `Â§r` after the dimension name to remove the coloring of the dimension's name.
-   Fixed a bug where the `config.chatRanks.nameTagTemplateString` property referenced the world `andexdbSettings:messageTemplateString` dynamic property instead of the world `andexdbSettings:nameTagTemplateString` dynamic property, causing the name tags to use the message template string instead of their own custom template string.
-   Fixed the chat ranks when advanced mode is selected, to use the `andexdbSettings:rankDisplaySeparator` setting instead of the `andexdbSettings:chatNameAndMessageSeparator` setting to separate the ranks.

### Commands

-   Fixed a bug where the `\butcher` and `\butcherdespawn` commands would not kill experience bottles when the `j` flag was specified, this was caused by the entity id for the experience bottles being mistyped as `minecraft:xb_bottle` instead of `minecraft:xp_bottle`.

### Commands Documentation

-   Added the missing documentation for the `f`, `n`, and `w` flags for the `\butcher` and `\butcherdespawn` command.
