## Additions

### Settings

-   Added a new `pvpCooldownToTeleport` option to stop players from teleporting away while in a PVP battle.

## Fixes

### Commands

-   Fixed the `\spawn` command.

### Technical

-   Fixed a bug where if the z coordinate passed into the `vTStr` function was 0 then it would treat it as a `Vector2` instead of a `Vector3` and not display the z coordinate.

### Chat Ranks

-   Fixed a bug where the nameColor:red would not apply the red name color "§c" because its color code value was set to "§" instead of "§c".
-   Updated the chat ranks to include the nameFormatting before the player's name.
-   Updated the default message template string to include the nameFormatting property before the player's name.
