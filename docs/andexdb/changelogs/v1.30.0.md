## Add-On Connectivity

-   The add-on is now fully compatible and integrates with the BlueMods Anticheat Add-On (Versions 5.7.0 and up.).

## Critical Bug Fixes

### Chat Ranks

-   Fixed a bug where the name tag chat ranks would cause errors, causing the editor stick to not work either.

## Additions

### Commands

-   Added the `\bluemodsversion` command to get the version of BlueMods Anticheat that is currently active on the world realm or server.

## Changes

### Chat Ranks

-   If the chat rank template string causes any errors, you can now see them in chat if you have the `getNameTagRankSettingsErrors` tag, and they will no longer cause the editor stick not to work.
