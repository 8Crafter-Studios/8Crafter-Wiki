## Critical Bug Fixes

### Script Form UI Text Boxes

-   Fixed an issue where the on-screen keyboard would not appear for players who were on xbox when they were trying to type in the script form UI text boxes. This was caused by the character limit being at 100,000,000, when for some reason, even though every other device can handle a character limit of 100,000,000, the Xbox won't even work with 50,000. So a side-effect of this fix is that for Xbox users, the character limit will be set to 10,000, the character limit for all other devices will still be 100,000,000.
