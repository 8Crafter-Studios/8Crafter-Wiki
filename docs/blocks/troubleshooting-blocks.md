## Step-by-step Block Debugging

## 0.0.0 - Trouble

I followed a tutorial or tried to make my own block and something's wrong! Calm down. This page will help debug common issues. <BButton color="blue" link="troubleshooting-blocks#_1-0-0-my-block-has-a-black-magenta-checkered-pattern-my-textures-are-missing">Continue</BButton>

## 1.0.0 - My Block Has a Black-Magenta checkered pattern/My Textures Are Missing!

I will be reviewing three different types of blocks that have different layouts: Dirt-like ![](/assets/images/blocks/block_tr/tr_dirt.png), Log-like ![](/assets/images/blocks/block_tr/tr_log.png), Grass-like ![](/assets/images/blocks/block_tr/tr_grass.png)

1.10 Block <BButton color="blue" link="troubleshooting-blocks#_1-10-blocks">Continue</BButton>

1.16.100 Block <BButton color="blue" link="troubleshooting-blocks#_1-16-100-blocks">Continue</BButton>

## 1.10 Blocks

Navigate to your `blocks.json`. Ensure that it is properly named.

<CodeHeader>RP/blocks.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
	"format_version": [1, 1, 0],
	"wiki:dirt_like": {
		"textures": "dirt_like", //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
		"sound": "your_sound_name"
	},
	"wiki:log_like": {
		"textures": {
			"up": "log_like_top", //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
			"down": "log_like_top", //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
			"side": "log_like_side" //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
		},
		"sound": "your_sound_name"
	},
	"wiki:grass_like": {
		"textures": {
			"up": "grass_like_top", //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
			"down": "grass_like_bottom", //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
			"side": "grass_like_side" //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
		},
		"sound": "your_sound_name"
	}
}
```

Next, navigate to your `terrain_texture.json`. Ensure that it is properly named.

<CodeHeader>RP/textures/terrain_texture.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
	"resource_pack_name": "tut",
	"texture_name": "atlas.terrain",
	"padding": 8,
	"num_mip_levels": 4,
	"texture_data": {
		"dirt_like": {
			"textures": "textures/blocks/dirt_like" //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
		},
		"log_like_top": {
			"textures": "textures/blocks/log_like_top" //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
		},
		"log_like_side": {
			"textures": "textures/blocks/log_like_side" //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
		},
		"grass_like_top": {
			"textures": "textures/blocks/grass_like_top" //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
		},
		"grass_like_bottom": {
			"textures": "textures/blocks/grass_like_bottom" //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
		},
		"grass_like_side": {
			"textures": "textures/blocks/grass_like_side" //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
		}
	}
}
```

If you followed this properly, your 1.10 block should now have correct texture.

## 1.16.100 Blocks

You can follow the exact same steps as the 1.10 blocks. But doing this method allows you to rotate your blocks.
Navigate to your `terrain_texture.json`. Ensure that it is properly named

<CodeHeader>RP/textures/terrain_texture.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
	"resource_pack_name": "tut",
	"texture_name": "atlas.terrain",
	"padding": 8,
	"num_mip_levels": 4,
	"texture_data": {
		"dirt_like": {
			"textures": "textures/blocks/dirt_like" //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
		},
		"log_like_top": {
			"textures": "textures/blocks/log_like_top" //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
		},
		"log_like_side": {
			"textures": "textures/blocks/log_like_side" //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
		},
		"grass_like_top": {
			"textures": "textures/blocks/grass_like_top" //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
		},
		"grass_like_bottom": {
			"textures": "textures/blocks/grass_like_bottom" //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
		},
		"grass_like_side": {
			"textures": "textures/blocks/grass_like_side" //You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
		}
	}
}
```

Next, navigate to your block file. In your block file, make sure you have the `material_instances` component.

Dirt like block example:
<CodeHeader>BP/blocks/dirt_like.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
    "format_version": "1.16.100",
    "minecraft:block": {
        "description": {
            "identifier": "wiki:dirt_like",
            "register_to_creative_menu": true
        },
        "components": {
            "minecraft:material_instances": {
                "*": {
                    "texture": "dirt_like",
                }
            },
            ...
        },
        "events": {...}
    }
}
```

Log like block example:
<CodeHeader>BP/blocks/log_like.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
    "format_version": "1.16.100",
    "minecraft:block": {
        "description": {
            "identifier": "wiki:log_like",
            "register_to_creative_menu": true
        },
        "components": {
            "minecraft:material_instances": {
                "*": {
                    "texture": "log_like_side"
                },
                "ends": {
                    "texture": "log_like_top"
                },
                "up": "ends",
                "down": "ends"
            },
            ...
        },
        "events": {...}
    }
}
```

Grass like block example:
<CodeHeader>BP/blocks/grass_like.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
    "format_version": "1.16.100",
    "minecraft:block": {
        "description": {
            "identifier": "wiki:grass_like",
            "register_to_creative_menu": true
        },
        "components": {
            "minecraft:material_instances": {
                "*": {
                    "texture": "grass_like_side"
                },
                "up": {
                    "texture": "grass_like_top"
                },
                "down": {
                    "texture": "grass_like_bottom"
                }
            },
            ...
        },
        "events": {...}
    }
}
```

If you followed this properly, your 1.16.100 block should now have correct texture.

## 2.0.0 - My Block Looks Like Dirt!

Problem: My custom block has turned into a dirt block with green writing on it. ![](/assets/images/blocks/block_tr/tr_update.png) This is called `info_update` block. This happens when the block identifier changed or an invalid json was made.

Solution: Use a json linter and double check that your identifier didn't change.

## 3.0.0 - Block Rendering

This section will describe common block rendering issues and how to fix them.

## 3.1.0 - Block isn't transparent!

Problem: You have transparent pixels in your texture file. When you apply it in game, they become opaque.

Solution: Navigate to your block file. Navigate to your `material_instances` component. Add the following to your component:

<CodeHeader>BP/blocks/your_block.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
	"format_version": "1.16.100",
	"minecraft:block": {
		"components": {
			"minecraft:material_instances": {
				"*": {
					"render_method": "alpha_test"
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## 3.2.0 - Block has shadow!

Problem: You have block with custom geometry but it has shadow.

Solution: Navigate to your block file. Navigate to your `material_instances` component. Add the following to your component:

<CodeHeader>BP/blocks/your_block.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
	"format_version": "1.16.100",
	"minecraft:block": {
		"components": {
			"minecraft:material_instances": {
				"*": {
					"face_dimming": false,
					"ambient_occlusion": false
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Another method:

Add following components to your block's code:

<CodeHeader>BP/blocks/your_block.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
	"format_version": "1.16.100",
	"minecraft:block": {
		"components": {
			"minecraft:block_light_emission": 0.0,
			"minecraft:block_light_absorption": 0
		}
	}
}
```

## 4.0.0 - Common Content Log Errors

This section will describe common content log errors and how to debug them.

## 4.1.0 - [Blocks][error]

Problem: Your content log shows `[Blocks][error]-minecraft:entity_collision: min can't be below (-8, 0, -8) and max can't be more than (8, 16, 8)` or `[Blocks][error]-minecraft:pick_collision: min can't be below (-8, 0, -8) and max can't be more than (8, 16, 8)`

Solution: Check your `entity_collision` or `pick_collision` components and do the following:

-   Make sure the x or z isn't less than -8.
-   Make sure the y isn't less than 0.
-   Make sure the size isn't bigger than 16x16x16.

## 4.2.0 - [Blocks][warning]

Problem: Your content log shows `geometry.your_block contains an X amount of boxes outside the warning bounds of (*insert numbers*) to (*insert numbers*)`

Solution: Don't worry. It's nothing to worry about. It's just telling you that you geometry is bigger than 16x16x16. You can either make the geometry smaller or just ignore it.
