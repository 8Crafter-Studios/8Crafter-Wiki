Have you ever wanted to change the height limit of your world in Minecraft Bedrock Edition? Well, this behavior pack lets you do that.

## General Description

Have you ever wanted to change the height limit of your world in Minecraft Bedrock Edition? Well, this behavior pack lets you do that.

This pack has many sub-packs, each for a different height range, you just scroll through them and find the one for your desired height limit range. This behavior pack actually does modify the height range, you can make even make the height range smaller than it normally is.

The smallest range that you can set it to is 16 blocks in total, the maximum range is a total of 1,024 blocks. You can make the minimum world height limit go all the way down to -512 blocks and the maximum go all the way up to 512 blocks. You can set the minimum and maximum values to any multiples of 16 that are between -512 and 512, as long as the maximum value is at least 16 blocks higher than the minimum value is.

Sadly, there is currently no way to modify the height range of the nether and the end, only the overworld, so this pack only affects the overworld.

**NOTE: Blocks that are outside of the height range will not get deleted, they just won't get loaded, and once you increase the height range again then they will come back into the world again.**

**WARNING: This add-on will also cause any new unsaved chunks generated while the add-on is active to generate as void chunks!**
