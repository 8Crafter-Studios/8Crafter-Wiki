In order to use any of the following secondary selectors, you must first have a primary selector. To start with secondary selectors you must add brackets <code>[]</code> to the end of the chosen selector like this <code>kill @e[]</code>. There are many secondary selectors you can use so let&#39;s start.</p><ul><li><code>kill @e[c=&lt;count&gt;]</code> Where <code>&lt;count&gt;</code> is the number you want. The selector <code>c</code> stands for count. It allows you to choose how many entities to select. For example, the command <code>/kill @e[c=4]</code> will kill four entities. The selector <code>c</code> will target in a specific order depending on how it is used. If the selector used is <code>@r</code> then <code>c</code> will target randomly E.g. <code>/kill @r[c=4]</code> will kill four random players. if <code>@r</code> is not used then c will kill from nearest to farthest unless the number given is negative. <code>kill @e[c=4]</code> will kill four entities nearest to farthest <code>kill @e[c=-4]</code> will still kill four entities but from farthest to nearest.</li><li><code>kill @e[name=&lt;name&gt;]</code> The selector <code>name</code> selects only entities with the name put in the place of <code>&lt;name&gt;</code>. If <code>=!</code> is used in place of <code>=</code> the selector will target entities without the name.</li><li><code>kill @e[l=&lt;level&gt;]</code> The selector <code>l</code> will target any players with an exp level equal to or greater than the value put in place of <code>&lt;level&gt;</code>.</li><li><code>kill @e[lm=&lt;levelm&gt;]</code> The selector <code>lm</code> will target any players with an exp level equal to or lower than the value put in place of <code>&lt;levelm&gt;</code>.</li><li><code>kill @e[m=&lt;gamemode&gt;]</code> The selector <code>m</code> will target any players who are in the mode put in place of <code>&lt;gamemode&gt;</code>. Possible values are: <code>survival</code>, <code>s</code>, and <code>0</code>, <code>creative</code>, <code>c</code>, and <code>1</code>, <code>adventure</code>, <code>a</code>, and <code>2</code>. If =! is used in place of = the selector will target players who are not in the selected mode.</li><li><code>kill @e[tag=&lt;tag&gt;]</code> The selector <code>tag</code> will target any entities with the tag put in place of <code>&lt;tag&gt;</code>. If <code>=!</code> is used in place of <code>=</code> the selector will target entities without the tag.</li><li><code>kill @e[r=&lt;radius&gt;]</code> The selector <code>r</code> will target any players whose distance in blocks from the location of the command execution is equal to or less than the value put in place of <code>&lt;radius&gt;</code>.</li><li><code>kill @e[rm=&lt;radiusm&gt;]</code> The selector <code>rm</code> will target any players whose distance in blocks from the location of the command execution is equal to or greater than the value put in place of <code>&lt;radiusm&gt;</code>.</li><li><code>kill @e[x=&lt;x&gt;,y=&lt;y&gt;,z=&lt;z&gt;]</code> These selectors must all be present together or not be there for a command to work. They do nothing by themselves but they modify other secondary selectors. They can modify <code>dx</code>, <code>dy</code>, <code>dz</code>, <code>rm</code>, <code>r</code>, and <code>c</code>. All of those previous selectors use a central starting location which can be set using <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>. Otherwise, the starting location will be set to the position of the executor of the command. Tildes ~ can be used in place of numbers for <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>.</li><li><code>kill @e[dx=&lt;dx&gt;,dy=&lt;dy&gt;,dz=&lt;dz&gt;]</code> These selectors must all be present together or not be there for a command to work. These selectors check if a player is in a volume. Starting at the location of the executor of the command <code>dx</code> will add the value put in <code>&lt;dx&gt;</code> to the x position to make a point. when <code>dx</code>, <code>dy</code>, and <code>dz</code> are used together they identify a point relative to the executor of the command. All entities within a box drawn between the executor of the command and the point made are selected.</li><li><code>kill @e[type=&lt;type&gt;]</code> This selector chooses the type of entity to be selected. The names of any entity can be replaced for <code>&lt;type&gt;</code> to choose the selection. If <code>type</code> is used with <code>@r</code> instead of <code>@r</code> selecting players <code>@r</code> will select the entity put in the place of <code>&lt;type&gt;</code>. This allows you to randomly select an entity of a specific type. If <code>=!</code> is used in place of <code>=</code> this selector will target entities other than the type. \u200C</li><li><code>kill @e[family=&lt;family&gt;]</code> This selector will select entities that are in the family put in place of <code>&lt;family&gt;</code>. This could be many things, <code>creeper</code> for all creepers, <code>monster</code> for any monster, <code>undead</code> for any undead mob, <code>mob</code> for any well... mob. If <code>=!</code> is used in place of <code>=</code> the selector will target entities not in the family.</li><li><code>kill @e[scores={&lt;scoreboard&gt;=&lt;score&gt;}]</code> This selector can read the score that a entity has from a scoreboard. In the place of <code>&lt;scoreboard&gt;</code> goes the name of the scoreboard you wish to test. In the place of <code>&lt;score&gt;</code> can go many things. If you want to check for a score of 10 just replace <code>&lt;score&gt;</code> with a 10. To invert a score selector use <code>=!</code> instead of <code>=</code>. You have to use <code>..</code> for checking between, above, and below a value(s). Think of <code>..</code> as the words &quot;between&quot; and &quot;continue&quot; it helps a lot. <ul><li><code>10..</code> is any number above or equal to ten.</li><li><code>..10</code> is any number below or equal to ten.</li><li><code>5..10</code> is any number between five and ten.</li></ul></li><li><code>kill @e[rx=&lt;xrotation&gt;]</code> The selector <code>rx</code> will target any entities with a rotation around the x axis equal to or less than the value put in place of <code>&lt;xrotation&gt;</code>. -90 would be straight up, 0 is straight horizontal, and 90 is down.</li><li><code>kill @e[rxm=&lt;xrotationm&gt;]</code> The selector <code>rxm</code> will target any entities a rotation around the x axis rotation equal to or greater than the value put in place of <code>&lt;xrotationm&gt;</code>. -90 would be straight up, 0 is straight horizontal, and 90 is down.</li><li><code>kill @e[ry=&lt;yrotation&gt;]</code> The selector <code>ry</code> will target any entities with a rotation around the y axis equal to or less than the value put in place of <code>&lt;yrotation&gt;</code>. -180 is north, -90 is east, 0 is south, 90 is west, 180 is north.</li><li><code>kill @e[rym=&lt;yrotationm&gt;]</code> The selector <code>rym</code> will target any entities with a rotation around the y axis equal to or greater than the value put in place of <code>&lt;yrotationm&gt;</code>. -180 is north, -90 is east, 0 is south, 90 is west, 180 is north.</li></ul><h2 id="tags" tabindex="-1">Tags <a class="header-anchor" href="#tags" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Tags are a way to discriminate towards a player, or group of players and or mobs. Tags can be useful in alot of ways like making a ranks system, and or making a server with a anticheat. Tags can be used in a number of ways, for example, <code>give @e[tag=steak] cooked_beef</code> will give everyone with the tag steak, one steak. There are a number of ways you can use tags but we will be looking at the most used options.</p><ul><li><code>kill @e[tag=&lt;tag&gt;]</code> This is how you would kill all the players with your given tag. Its useful if you are making a minigame, and a player were to lose, you could kill them then set there gamemode into something else with a command block.</li><li><code>kill @e[tag=!&lt;tag&gt;]</code> This will kill all of the entities that <strong>DONT</strong> have the tag that you specified.</li><li><code>tag @a &lt;add | remove | list&gt; &lt;tag&gt;</code> This is how you would give, or remove a tag, useing <code>add</code> or <code>remove</code>. If you want to see what tags a player has then you can do <code>tag &lt;selector&gt; list</code></li></ul><h2 id="combining-selectors" tabindex="-1">Combining Selectors <a class="header-anchor" href="#combining-selectors" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Secondary selectors can be used together by utilizing commas. Make sure to split each selector into its own part. As an example <code>@e[type=&lt;type&gt;]</code> and <code>@e[name=&lt;name&gt;]</code> can be combined like this: <code>@e[type=&lt;type&gt;,name=&lt;name&gt;]</code>. However, with the <code>score</code> selector you must format checks to another scoreboard like this, <code>@e[scores={&lt;scoreboard&gt;=&lt;score&gt;,&lt;scoreboard2&gt;=&lt;score2&gt;}]</code>.</p><h2 id="other-useful-information" tabindex="-1">Other Useful Information <a class="header-anchor" href="#other-useful-information" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>There is one more primary selector on bedrock edition which is a very niche case, <code>@initiator</code>. When an NPC is set up to have a button run a command, <code>@initiator</code> can be used to target the player which clicked the button. Otherwise, <code>@p</code> might likely be used and the command might execute on a different player who is nearer to the NPC than the player who clicked the button.</p>`,14),i=[c];function s(d,r,n,h,u,m){return o(),t("div",null,i)}var y=e(a,[["render",s]]);export{p as __pageData,y as default};
