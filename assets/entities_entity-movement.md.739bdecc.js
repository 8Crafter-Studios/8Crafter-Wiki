To get these behaviors, your entity will generally need quite a few behaviors, broken out into various types.</p><p>As you read this tutorial, keep in mind that your entity will need at least:</p><ul><li><a href="#movement-speed">A component that sets the entities movement speed.</a></li><li><a href="#movement-type">A component to set how the entity will move (walking, flying, etc)</a></li><li><a href="#navigation-abilities">A component to set the entities navigation abilities, so it can generate paths.</a></li><li><a href="#ai">A component that sets where/when the entity should move (AI Goals).</a></li></ul><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p>The best way to create a moving entity is by picking a similar entity from the vanilla behavior pack, and copying the components into your entity.</p><p>For example entities like Phantom, or Ghast, or Parrot are all flying entities, but have very different in-game behavior!
